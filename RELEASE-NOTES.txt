Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.0-alpha7

Introduction
------------

This is an alpha release of Apache Jackrabbit 2.0. This release implements
a pre-release version of the JCR 2.0 API, specified by the Java Specification
Request 283 (JSR 283, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283).

The purpose of this alpha release is to allow people to test and review
the new JCR 2.0 features before they are finalized. Feedback to both the
Jackrabbit project and the JSR 283 expert group is highly appreciated.
Note that an alpha release is not expected to be feature-complete or
otherwise suitable for production use.

Changes in this release
-----------------------

Jackrabbit 2.0 is a major upgrade from the earlier 1.x releases. The most
notable changes in this release are:

  * Upgrade to JCR 2.0. This Jackrabbit release implements and is based
    on a pre-release version of the JCR 2.0 API. See below for a status
    listing of the issues related to JCR 2.0 changes. We expect to achieve
    full feature-completeness in time for the final Jackrabbit 2.0 release.

  * Upgrade to Java 5. All of Jackrabbit (except the jcr-tests component)
    now requires Java 5 as the base platform. Java 1.4 environments are no
    longer supported.

  * Removal of deprecated classes and features. Jackrabbit 2.0 is not
    backwards compatible with client code that used any classes or features
    that had been deprecated during the 1.x release cycle.

  * Separate JCR Commons components. Many of the general-purpose JCR
    components like JCR-RMI and OCM are now developed and released
    separately from the Jackrabbit content repository. See the individual
    components for their most recent releases.

  * Data store feature enabled in the default repository configuration.

Jackrabbit releases, please see the Jackrabbit issue tracker at
