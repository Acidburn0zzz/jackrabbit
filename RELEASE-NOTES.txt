Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 1.5.5

Introduction
------------

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). A content repository is a
hierarchical content store with support for structured and unstructured
content, full text search, versioning, transactions, observation, and
more. See the Jackrabbit web site at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/ for
more information.

Apache Jackrabbit 1.5.5 is a bug fix release that fixes issues reported
against previous releases. The jackrabbit-jcr2spi component contains also
some other improvements over previous releases. This release is fully
compatible with the earlier 1.5.x releases.

Release Contents
----------------

This release consists of a single source archive (jackrabbit-1.5.5-src.jar)
that contains all the Apache Jackrabbit components. Use the following
commands (or the equivalent in your system) to build the release with
Maven 2 and Java 1.4 or higher:

    jar xf jackrabbit-1.5.5-src.jar
    cd jackrabbit-1.5.5
    mvn install

Note that the OCM components require Java 5 or higher, and are not included
in the build when using Java 1.4.

The source archive is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
signature that you can use to verify the authenticity of your download.
The public key used for the PGP signature can be found at
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/dist/KEYS.

The build will result in the following components (with artifactIds in
parenthesis) being built and installed in your local Maven repository.
