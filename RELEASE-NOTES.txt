Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.0-beta5

Introduction
------------

This is a beta release of Apache Jackrabbit 2.0. This release is a fully
compliant implementation of the JCR 2.0 API that was specified by the
Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283).
However, the beta status of this release means that some parts of the
implementation are not yet ready for normal production use.

Changes in this release
-----------------------

Jackrabbit 2.0 is a major upgrade from the earlier 1.x releases. The most
notable changes in this release are:

  * Upgrade to JCR 2.0. This Jackrabbit release implements and is based
    on the official JCR 2.0 API. All of the features required by the
    JSR 283 specification have been implemented.

  * Upgrade to Java 5. All of Jackrabbit (except the jcr-tests component)
    now requires Java 5 as the base platform. Java 1.4 environments are no
    longer supported.

  * Removal of deprecated classes and features. Jackrabbit 2.0 is not
    backwards compatible with client code that used any classes or features
    that had been deprecated during the 1.x release cycle.

  * Separate JCR Commons components. Many of the general-purpose JCR
    components like JCR-RMI and OCM are now developed and released
    separately from the Jackrabbit content repository. See the individual
    components for their most recent releases.

  * Database connection pooling is now available for all database backends.

  * Data store feature enabled in the default repository configuration.

  * Full text indexing with Apache Tika. Jackrabbit can now extract and
    index the full text content of many new types of documents, including
    the Office Open XML files produced by Microsoft Office 2007 and higher.

  * Apache Commons Collections, Apache Derby, Jetty, SLF4J and Apache Xerces
    have been upgraded to a more recent version.

  * OracleFileSystem class does not use special blob handling anymore and is
    required for 10R1 and earlier anymore. If you need that use the new
    Oracle9FileSystem.
