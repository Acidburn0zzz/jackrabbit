Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 1.0

Introduction
------------

The Apache Jackrabbit project is an effort to build and maintain
an open source implementation of the Content Repository for Java
Technology API (JCR) specified in the Java Specification Request 170
(JSR-170).

Apache Jackrabbit 1.0 is a fully conforming and stable JSR-170
implementation. Developed from the same source tree as the JSR-170
reference implementation, the 1.0 release implements the full JCR API,
including level 1, level 2, and all the optional features like
versioning, transactions, and observation.

See the Apache Jackrabbit website at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/
for more information.

Release Contents
----------------

The main contents of this release are the Apache Jackrabbit core
content repository implementation and the related general-purpose
JCR utilities:

     jackrabbit-core-1.0-src.jar

     jackrabbit-core-1.0.jar
     jackrabbit-jcr-commons-1.0.jar

This release contains also additional components that offer extra
functionality for use with either Apache Jackrabbit core or any
JCR compliant content repository. These modules should be considered
alpha quality:

 * RMI network layer for the JCR API.

     jackrabbit-jcr-rmi-1.0-src.jar
     jackrabbit-jcr-rmi-1.0.jar

 * Deployable Jackrabbit installation with WebDAV support for JCR.

     jackrabbit-jcr-server-1.0-src.jar

     jackrabbit-jcr-webdav-1.0.jar
     jackrabbit-jcr-client-1.0.jar
     jackrabbit-jcr-server-1.0.jar
     jackrabbit-server-1.0.war

 * J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) resource adapter for Jackrabbit.

     jackrabbit-jca-1.0-src.jar
     jackrabbit-jca-1.0.rar

 * Text indexing filters for Jackrabbit. Includes example filters
   for Adobe PDF and MS Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

     jackrabbit-index-filters-1.0-src.jar
     jackrabbit-index-filters-1.0.jar

All components are released as a source jar file and one or more compiled
binary files. All files contain a README.txt file with more information.
Note that external runtime dependencies are only included for the war
and rar archives. Other dependencies can be downloaded either manually
or automatically using the Maven build system.

Each release file is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
signature. The public key used for the signatures can be found
in the KEYS file located in the parent directory.

Upgrading from 0.9
------------------

Due to a change in query functionality (JCR-257) a full rebuild of the
full text indexes is required on existing content repositories when
upgrading from the 0.9 release. Reindexing can be triggered by manually
removing the index directories when the repository has been shut down.
