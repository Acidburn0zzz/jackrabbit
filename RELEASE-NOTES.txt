Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 1.6.0

Introduction
------------

Apache Jackrabbit 1.6 is an incremental feature release. While
remaining compatible with previous releases, Jackrabbit 1.6 introduces
a number of new features, improvements and fixes to known issues.

The most notable changes in this release are:

    * The RepositoryCopier tool makes it easy to backup and migrate
      repositories (JCR-442). There is also improved support for selectively
      copying content and version histories between repositories (JCR-1972).

    * A new WebDAV-based JCR remoting layer has been added to complement
      the existing JCR-RMI layer (JCR-1877, JCR-1958).

    * Query performance has been further optimized (JCR-1820, JCR-1855
      and JCR-2025).

    * Added support for Ingres and MaxDB/SapDB databases (JCR-1960, JCR-1527).

    * Session.refresh() can now be used to synchronize a cluster node
      with changes from the other nodes in the cluster (JCR-1753).

    * Unreferenced version histories are now automatically removed once
      all the contained versions have been removed (JCR-134).

    * Standalone components like the JCR-RMI layer and the OCM framework
      have been moved to a separate JCR Commons subproject of Jackrabbit,
      and are not included in this release. Updates to those components
      will be distributed as separate releases.

    * Development preview: There are even more JSR 283 features in
      Jackrabbit 1.6 than were included in the 1.5 version. These new
      features are accessible through special "jsr283" interfaces in
      the Jackrabbit API. Note that none of these features are ready
      for production use, and will be replaced with final JCR 2.0 versions
      in Jackrabbit 2.0.

Release Contents
----------------

This release consists of a single source archive (jackrabbit-1.6.0-src.jar)
that contains all the Apache Jackrabbit components. Use the following
commands (or the equivalent in your system) to build the release with
Maven 2 and Java 1.4 or higher:

    jar xf jackrabbit-1.6.0-src.jar
    cd jackrabbit-1.6.0-src
    mvn install

The source archive is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
signature that you can use to verify the authenticity of your download.
The public key used for the PGP signature can be found at
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/dist/KEYS.

Upgrading to Jackrabbit 1.6
---------------------------

Apache Jackrabbit 1.6 is fully compatible with the previous 1.x releases.
A previous Apache Jackrabbit 1.x installation can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant jar files with the new versions and adding some new dependencies.
No changes to repository contents are needed.

The Lucene dependency was upgraded to 2.4.1. Note that Jackrabbit 1.6 only
works with this version of Lucene, not with earlier versions and possibly
not even with later versions due to the tight integration with Lucene
internals (JCR-1855).

The POI dependency was upgraded to 3.2-FINAL.

Repository configuration has been extended with options for the repository
lock mechanism. No changes to existing configuration files are needed unless
you need to use this new feature (JCR-1605).
