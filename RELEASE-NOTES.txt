Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.0.6

Introduction
------------

Apache Jackrabbit 2.0.6 is a bug fix release that fixes issues reported
against previous releases. This release is fully compatible with the
earlier 2.0.x releases.

Security advisory (JCR-3883 / CVE-2015-1833)
--------------------------------------------

This release fixes an important security issue in the jackrabbit-webdav module
reported by Mikhail Egorov.

When processing a WebDAV request body containing XML, the XML parser can be 
instructed to read content from network resources accessible to the host, 
identified by URI schemes such as "http(s)" or  "file". Depending on the 
WebDAV request, this can not only be used to trigger internal network 
requests, but might also be used to insert said content into the request, 
potentially exposing it to the attacker and others (for instance, by inserting
said content in a WebDAV property value using a PROPPATCH request). See also
IETF RFC 4918, Section 20.6.

Users of the jackrabbit-webdav module are advised to immediately update the
module to this release or disable WebDAV access to the repository.
