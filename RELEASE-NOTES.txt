Release Contents
----------------

This release consists of a single source archive (jackrabbit-1.5.7-src.jar)
that contains all the Apache Jackrabbit components. Use the following
commands (or the equivalent in your system) to build the release with
Maven 2 and Java 1.4 or higher:

    jar xf jackrabbit-1.5.7-src.jar
    cd jackrabbit-1.5.7
    mvn install

Note that the OCM components require Java 5 or higher, and are not included
in the build when using Java 1.4.

The source archive is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
signature that you can use to verify the authenticity of your download.
The public key used for the PGP signature can be found at
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/dist/KEYS.

The build will result in the following components (with artifactIds in
parenthesis) being built and installed in your local Maven repository.
Pre-built binary artifacts of these components are also available on
the on the central Maven repository.

  * Jackrabbit Parent POM (jackrabbit-parent)
    The Maven parent POM for all Jackrabbit components.

  * Jackrabbit API (jackrabbit-api)
