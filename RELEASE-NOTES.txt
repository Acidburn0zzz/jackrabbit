Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.1.0

Introduction
------------

This is Apache Jackrabbit 2.1.0, a fully compliant and production-ready
implementation of the Content Repository for Java Technology API, version 2.0
(JCR 2.0, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=283).

Changes in this release
-----------------------

Jackrabbit 2.1 is an incremental feature release based on the earlier
2.0 release. The most notable changes in this release are:

  * Remoting improvements. Both the WebDAV and RMI remoting layers have
    been extended to support a wider subset of JCR 2.0 functionality
    and include numerous other improvements and bug fixes over previous
    releases. We recommend the WebDAV layer as the primary remoting option,
    with the RMI layer as a secondary option if more functionality is needed.

  * Command line repository access. The jackrabbit-standalone jar now
    contains a simple command line tool for browsing and modifying both
    local and remote repositories.

  * Improved JCA packaging. The jackrabbit-jca package can now be used to
    enable JCA-based access to any JCR repository that supports the JCR 2.0
    RepositoryFactory interface.
