Data consistency issue in 2.2.[0-6]
-----------------------------------

Earlier 2.2.x releases (< 2.2.7) had a problem where very large positive
or negative long property values (more than 62 bits) could not be correctly
read from the reepository. The values are still correctly stored in the
reporistory, and can be properly read after upgrading to this release,
but any previous computations or other information derived from such
properties should be checked for correctness.

Release Contents
----------------

This release consists of a single source archive packaged as a zip file.
The archive can be unpacked with the jar tool from your JDK installation.
See the README.txt file for instructions on how to build this release.

The source archive is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
