Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 0.9

Introduction
------------

The Apache Jackrabbit project is an effort to build and maintain
an open source implementation of the Content Repository for Java
Technology API (JCR) specified in the Java Specification Request 170
(JSR-170).

The version 0.9 release is the first official release of the
Jackrabbit project. The goal of this release is to provide a tested
and packaged version of Jackrabbit for users who have so far been
using custom snapshots. This release also provides a well defined
baseline for the upcoming Jackrabbit version 1.0.

Users of this release should note that the JCR extensions and internal
component interfaces in this release may not be upwards compatible 
with the upcoming 1.0 release.

Incubation
----------

Apache Jackrabbit is an effort undergoing incubation at the
Apache Software Foundation. Incubation is required of all newly
accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a
reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it
does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed
by the ASF.  The incubation status is recorded at

   http://incubator.apache.org/projects/jackrabbit.html

Release Contents
----------------

This release contains the main Jackrabbit implementation and the
JCR-RMI network layer for the JCR API. The JCR utility library
jackrabbit-commons is also included in this release.

The release contains both binary and source jar files. The binary
jackrabbit and jackrabbit-commons jar files are built from the
jackrabbit-0.9-incubating-src.jar file, and the binary jcr-rmi jar
file from the jcr-rmi-0.9-incubating-src.jar file.

The runtime dependency libraries are not included in the release,
you need to download the dependencies separately.

Each release file is accompanied by an MD5 checksum and a PGP
signature. The public key used for the signatures is located
in the KEYS file located in the parent directory.
