Node type unregistration problem in 2.2.[0-10]
----------------------------------------------

Earlier 2.2.x releases (< 2.2.11) mistakenly allowed node types to be
unregistered without no checks on whether those types are still referenced
in content. Before Jackrabbit 2.1 the "checkForReferencesInContent" method
used to always throw a "not yet implemented" exception since we haven't yet
implemented that functionality and didn't want people to accidentally break
the consistency of their content by removing types that are still used.
However, before the 2.1 release this exception was accidentally disabled
and thus in Jackrabbit versions 2.1.x and 2.2.x it has so far been possible
to remove node types with no such consistency constraints.

This issue was fixed in Jackrabbit 2.2.11 by re-enabling the exception in
the checkForReferencesInContent method, which will break all client code
that tries to unregister node types. If you need this functionality and
are aware of the potential problems, you can restore the old behaviour
by setting the disableCheckForReferencesInContentException system property
to "true".

Data consistency issue in 2.2.[0-6]
-----------------------------------

Earlier 2.2.x releases (< 2.2.7) had a problem where very large positive
or negative long property values (more than 62 bits) could not be correctly
read from the reepository. The values are still correctly stored in the
reporistory, and can be properly read after upgrading to this release,
but any previous computations or other information derived from such
properties should be checked for correctness.

Release Contents
----------------

This release consists of a single source archive packaged as a zip file.
The archive can be unpacked with the jar tool from your JDK installation.
See the README.txt file for instructions on how to build this release.

The source archive is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
signature that you can use to verify the authenticity of your download.
The public key used for the PGP signature can be found at
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/dist/KEYS.
