Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 1.3.4

Introduction
------------

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). A content repository is a
hierarchical content store with support for structured and unstructured
content, full text search, versioning, transactions, observation, and
more. Typical applications that use content repositories include content
management, document management, and records management systems.

Apache Jackrabbit 1.3.4 is patch release with ...

        The main source archive contains a "jackrabbit-1.3.4-src" directory
        with the full released source code and build environment. Use the
        following commands (or the equivalent in your system) to build all
        the released components with Maven 2:

          $ jar xf jackrabbit-1.3.4-src.jar

        WebDAV server or client.

All files contain a README.txt file with more information. Note that
external runtime dependencies are only included for the war and rar
archives. Other dependencies can be downloaded either manually or
automatically using the Maven build system.

Each release file is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
signature. The public key used for the signatures can be found
in the KEYS file located in the parent directory.

Upgrading to Jackrabbit 1.3
---------------------------

Apache Jackrabbit 1.3 is fully compatible with the previous 1.x releases.
A previous Apache Jackrabbit 1.x installation can be upgraded by replacing
the relevant jar files with the new versions. No changes to repository
contents are needed.

This release replaces the previous jackrabbit-index-filters component with
an improved jackrabbit-text-extractors component. An existing Jackrabbit
installation can be upgraded to use the new text extraction components by
deploying the new jackrabbit-text-extractors jar file and updating the
relevant search index configuration. Jackrabbit still supports old index
filter configurations, but to use them you need to leave the old
jackrabbit-index-filters jar file in place.

See below for a more detailed description of the structural changes in
the Apache Jackrabbit 1.2 release.

Upgrading to Jackrabbit 1.2
---------------------------

The most notable effect of the component restructuring in the 1.2 release
was that the previous jackrabbit-core component has been split in three
pieces: jackrabbit-api, jackrabbit-jcr-commons, and jackrabbit-core. Thus
you need to replace the previous jackrabbit-core-1.x.jar file with the
three new jar archives.

The structure of the WebDAV components have also changed. WebDAV support
now consists of the webapp component jackrabbit-webapp and the libraries
jackrabbit-webdav and jackrabbit-jcr-server.

The Apache Lucene dependency used for full text indexing has been upgraded
to version 2.0 in this release. Lucene 2.0 is able to continue using
existing index files, but you can also manually recreate the index with
Lucene 2.0 extensions by removing the "index" directories of a closed
repository. Jackrabbit will automatically re-index content when the
repository is next started.

Also the Apache Derby dependency has been upgraded to version 10.2.
Like Lucene, the new Derby version can keep using existing database files.
New repositories and workspaces will however be created using extensions
and improvements introduced in the 10.2 version.
