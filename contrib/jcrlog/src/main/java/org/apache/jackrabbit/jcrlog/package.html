<body>
<p>
Contains the Log Wrapper implementation for the JCR API.
The Log Wrapper is used to log application method calls to a JCR implementation,
for example Jackrabbit. The generated log contains all method calls to all
methods of the JCR API, together with the parameter values used.
The file is human readable and contains Java source code.
</p>
There are two ways to use the Log Wrapper:
<ul>
<li>
	Just after opening the 'real' repository (for example a Jackrabbit repository),
	wrap it using:<br />
	{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.jcrlog.RepositoryLogger#wrap(javax.jcr.Repository, java.lang.String) RepositoryLogger.wrap(theRepository, settings)}.
</li>
<li>
	Instantiate the repository using:<br />
	 RepositoryFactory.open(url).
	<br />
	{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.jcrlog.RepositoryFactory#open(java.lang.String) RepositoryFactory.open(url)}.
</li>
</ul>
Afterwards, the repository can be used in the usual way.
All other classes are not meant to be used by the application directly.
