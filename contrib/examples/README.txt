Requirements
------------

This project assumes that you have already successfully compiled and 
installed the parent project Jackrabbit into your maven repository.
If this is not the case, go back to the root project and launch

  maven jar:install

which will build and copy Jackrabbit into ~/.maven/repository/jackrabbit/jars
