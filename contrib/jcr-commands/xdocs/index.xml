            <p> This project contains a jcr command line client. It's backed by
                a set of Apache Commons Chain commands that perform operations
                on any JCR compliant repository. Moreover it includes a few
                jackrabbit specific commands to cover some use cases that were
                not included in the specification. <br/> For more information
                about using Commons Chain please refer to
                http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/chain/ </p>
