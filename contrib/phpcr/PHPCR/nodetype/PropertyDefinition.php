    /**
     * Gets the array of constraint strings. Each string in the array specifies
     * a constraint on the value of the property. The constraints are OR-ed together,
     * meaning that in order to be valid, the value must meet at least one of the
     * constraints. For example, a constraint array of <code>["constraint1", "constraint2",
     * "constraint3"]</code> has the interpretation: "the value of this property must
     * meet either constraint1, constraint2 or constraint3".
     * <p>
     * Reporting of value constraints is optional. An implementation may return
     * <code>null</code>, indicating that value constraint information is unavailable
     * (though a constraint may still exist).
     * <p/>
     * Returning an empty array, on the other hand, indicates that value constraint information
     * is available and that no constraints are placed on this value.
     * <p>
     * In the case of multi-value properties, the constraint string array
     * returned applies to all the values of the property.
     * <p>
     * The constraint strings themselves having differing formats and interpretations
     * depending on the type of the property in question. The following describes the
     * value constraint syntax for each property type:
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <code>STRING</code>: The constraint string is a regular expression pattern. For example the
     * regular expression "<code>.*</code>" means "any string, including the empty string". Whereas
     * a simple literal string (without any RE-specific meta-characters) like "<code>banana</code>"
     * matches only the string "<code>banana</code>".
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <code>PATH</code>: The constraint string is a <i>JCR path</i> with an optional "<code>*</code>" character after
     * the last "<code>/</code>" character. For example,  possible constraint strings for a property
     * of type <code>PATH</code> include:
     * <ol>
     * <li>
     * "<code>/myapp:products/myapp:televisions</code>"
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * "<code>/myapp:products/myapp:televisions/</code>"
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * "<code>/myapp:products/*</code>"
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * "<code>myapp:products/myapp:televisions</code>"
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * "<code>../myapp:televisions</code>"
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * "<code>../myapp:televisions/*</code>"
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * The following principles apply:
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * The "*" means "matches descendants" not "matches any subsequent path". For example,
     * <code>/a/*</code> does not match <code>/a/../c</code>.
     * The constraint must match the normalized path.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * Relative path constraint only match relative path values and absolute path
     * constraints only match absolute path values.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * A trailing "<code>/</code>" has no effect (hence, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, above, are equivalent).
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * The trailing "<code>*</code>" character means that the value of the <code>PATH</code> property is
     * restricted to the indicated subtree (in other words any additional relative path
     * can replace the "<code>*</code>"). For example, 3, above would allow
     * <code>/myapp:products/myapp:radios</code>, <code>/myapp:products/myapp:microwaves/X900</code>, and so
     * forth.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * A constraint without a "<code>*</code>" means that the <code>PATH</code> property is restricted to that
     * precise path. For example, <code>1</code>, above, would allow only the value
     * <code>/myapp:products/myapp:televisions</code>.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * The constraint can indicate either a relative path or an absolute path
     * depending on whether it includes a leading "<code>/</code>" character. <code>1</code> and <code>4</code>, above for
     * example, are distinct.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * The string returned must reflect the namespace mapping in the current <code>Session</code>
     * (i.e., the current state of the namespace registry overlaid with any
     * session-specific mappings). Constraint strings for <code>PATH</code> properties should be
     * stored in fully-qualified form (using the actual URI instead of the prefix) and
     * then be converted to prefix form according to the current mapping upon the
     * <code>PropertyDefinition.getValueConstraints</code> call.
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <code>NAME</code>: The constraint string is a <i>JCR name</i> in prefix form. For example
     * "<code>myapp:products</code>". No wildcards or other pattern matching are supported. As with
     * <code>PATH</code> properties, the string returned must reflect the namespace mapping in the
     * current <code>Session</code>. Constraint strings for <code>NAME</code> properties should be stored in
     * fully-qualified form (using the actual URI instead of the prefix) and then be
     * converted to prefix form according to the current mapping.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <code>REFERENCE</code>: The constraint string is a <i>JCR name</i> in prefix form. This name is
     * interpreted as a node type name and the <code>REFERENCE</code> property is restricted to
     * referring only to nodes that have at least the indicated node type. For
     * example, a constraint of "<code>mytype:document</code>" would indicate that the REFERENCE
     * property in question can only refer to nodes that have at least the node type
     * <code>mytype:document</code> (assuming this was the only constraint returned in the array,
     * recall that the array of constraints are to be "OR-ed" together). No wildcards or other
     * pattern matching are supported. As with <code>PATH</code> properties, the string returned
     * must reflect the namespace mapping in the current <code>Session</code>. Constraint strings
     * for <code>REFERENCE</code> properties should be stored in fully-qualified form (using the
     * actual URI instead of the prefix) and then be converted to prefix form according to the
     * current mapping.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <code>BOOLEAN</code>: Either "<code>true</code>" or "<code>false</code>".
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * The remaining types all have value constraints in the form of inclusive or
     * exclusive ranges: i.e., "<code>[min, max]</code>", "<code>(min, max)</code>",
     * "<code>(min, max]</code>" or "<code>[min, max)</code>". Where "<code>[</code>"
     * and "<code>]</code>" indicate "inclusive", while "<code>(</code>" and "<code>)</code>"
     * indicate "exclusive". A missing <code>min</code> or <code>max</code> value
     * indicates no bound in that direction. For example [,5] means no minimum but a
     * maximum of 5 (inclusive) while [,] means simply that any value will suffice,
     * The meaning of the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> values themselves
     * differ between types as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <code>BINARY</code>: <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> specify the allowed
     * size range of the binary value in bytes.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <code>DATE</code>: <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are dates specifying the
     * allowed date range. The date strings must be in the ISO8601-compliant format:
     * <code>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD</code>.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <code>LONG</code>, <code>DOUBLE</code>: min and max are numbers.
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * Because constraints are returned as an array of disjunctive constraints,
     * in many cases the elements of the array can serve directly as a "choice list".
     * This may, for example, be used by an application to display options to the
     * end user indicating the set of permitted values.
     *
     * @return a <code>String</code> array.
