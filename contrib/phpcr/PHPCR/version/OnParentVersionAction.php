/**
 * The possible actions specified by the <code>onParentVersion</code> attribute
 * in a property definition within a node type definition.
 * <p>
 * <b>Level 2 only</b>
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the following actions:
 * <UL>
 *    <LI>COPY
 *    <LI>VERSION
 *    <LI>INITIALIZE
 *    <LI>COMPUTE
 *    <LI>IGNORE
 *    <LI>ABORT
 * </UL>
 * <p>
 * Every item (node or property) in the repository has a status indicator that
 * governs what happens to that item when its parent node is versioned. This
 * status is defined by the onParentVersion attribute in the PropertyDef or
 * NodeDef that applies to the item in question. This PropertyDef or NodeDef is
 * part of the NodeType of the parent node of the item in question.
 * <p>
 * For example, let N be a versionable node in workspace W of repository R.
 * Furthermore, let N be of node type T, where T is a sub-type of
 * nt:versionable and T allows N to have one property called P and one child
 * node called C.
 * <p>
 * What happens to P and C when N is versioned depends on their respective
 * OnParentVersion attribute as defined in the PropertyDef for P and the
 * NodeDef for C, found in the definition of node type T.
 * <p>
 * The possible values for the OnParentVersion attribute are: COPY, VERSION,
 * INITIALIZE, COMPUTE, NOTHING and FORBIDDEN.
 * <p>
 * The sections below describe, for each possible value of the OnParentVersion
 * attribute, what happens to C and P when,
 * <ul>
 * <li>N.checkin() is performed, creating the new version VN and adding to the
 * version history.
 * <li>N.restore(VN)  is performed, restoring the version VN.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * COPY
 * <p>
 * Child Node
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, C and all its descendent items, down to the leaves of the
 * subtree, will be copied to the version storage as a child subtree of VN. The
 * copy of C and its subtree will not have its own version history but will be
 * part of the state preserved in VN. C itself need not be versionable.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the copy of C and its subtree stored will be restored as
 * well, replacing the current C and its subtree in the workspace.
 * <p>
 * Property
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, P will be copied to the version storage as a child of VN.
 * This copy of P is part of the state preserved in VN.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the copy of P stored as its child will be restored as
 * well, replacing the current P in the workspace.
 * <p>
 * VERSION
 * <p>
 * Child Node
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, the node VN will get a child reference to the version
 * history of C (not to C or any actual version of C). In practice, this means
 * that the root version of C's version history becomes the child of VN
 * because, as mentioned before, the root version is used as the referent when
 * a reference to the version history as a whole is required. This also
 * requires that C itself be versionable (otherwise it would not have a version
 * history). If C is not versionable then behavior of IGNORE applies on checkin
 * (see below).
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, if the workspace currently has an already existing node
 * corresponding to C's version history, then that instance of C becomes the
 * child of the restored N. If the workspace does not have an instance of C
 * then one is restored from C's version history. The workspace in which the
 * restore is being performed will determine which particular version of C will
 * be restored. This determination depends on the configuration of the
 * workspace and is outside the scope of this specification.
 * <p>
 * Property
 * <p>
 * In the case of properties, an OnParentVersion attribute of VERSION has the
 * same effect as COPY.
 * <p>
 * INITIALIZE
 * <p>
 * Child Node
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, a new node C will be created and placed in version storage
 * as a child of VN. This new C will be initialized just as it would be if
 * created normally in a workspace. No state information of the current C in
 * the workspace is preserved. The new C will not have its own version history
 * but will be part of the state preserved in VN. C itself need not be
 * versionable.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the C stored as its child will be restored as well,
 * replacing the current C in the workspace.
 * <p>
 * Property
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, a new P will be created and placed in version storage as a
 * child of VN. The new P will be initialized just as it would be if created
 * normally in a workspace. The new P is part of the state preserved in VN.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the P stored as its child will be restored as well,
 * replacing the current P in the workspace.
 * <p>
 * COMPUTE
 * <p>
 * Child Node
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, a new node C will be created and placed in version storage
 * as a child of VN. This new C will be initialized according to some
 * configuration-specific procedure beyond the scope of this specification. The
 * new C will not have its own version history but will be part of the state
 * preserved in VN. C itself need not be versionable.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the C stored as its child will be restored as well,
 * replacing the current C in the workspace.
 * <p>
 * Property
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, a new P will be created and placed in version storage as a
 * child of VN. The new P will be initialized according to some
 * configuration-specific procedure beyond the scope of this specification. The
 * new P is part of the state preserved in VN.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the P stored as its child will be restored as well,
 * replacing the current P in the workspace.
 * <p>
 * IGNORE
 * <p>
 * Child Node
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, no state information about C will be stored in VN.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the child node C of the current N will remain and not be
 * removed, despite not being included in the state recorded in VN, since its
 * IGNORE status tells the system to leave it alone.
 * <p>
 * Property
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N, no state information about P will be stored in VN.
 * <p>
 * On restore of VN, the property P of the current N will remain and not be
 * removed, despite not being included in the state of recorded in VN, since
 * its IGNORE status tells the system to leave it alone.
 * <p>
 * ABORT
 * <p>
 * Child Node or Property
 * <p>
 * On checkin of N an exception will be thrown. Having a child node or property
 * with an OnParentVersion attribute of ABORT prevents the parent node from
 * being checked-in.
