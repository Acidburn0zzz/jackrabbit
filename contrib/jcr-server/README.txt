installed the parent project Jackrabbit and the contrib project jcr-rmi
into your maven repository. If this is not the case, go back to the root
project and launch

  maven jar:install

which will build and copy Jackrabbit into ~/.maven/repository/jackrabbit/jars

Also go to the contrib project jcr-rmi and launch

  maven jar:install

which will build and copy jcr-rmi to ~/.maven/repository/jcr-rmi/jars
