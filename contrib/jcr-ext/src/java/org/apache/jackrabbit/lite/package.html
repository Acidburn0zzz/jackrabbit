Lightweight implementation of the JCR API.
<p>
This package contains lightweight implementations of the JCR API interfaces.
The implementation classes inherit from the
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.base general base classes} and implement as
much of the JCR functionality as reasonably possible without actually
storing anything.
<p>
In addition to the JCR API methods, the classes in this package also provide
a set of protected methods that allow subclasses to selectively modify the
implemented behaviour. The implementation details are documented using
Javadoc comments.
<p>
The purpose of this package is to provide a reasonable starting point
for implementing a simple JCR adapter for an existing content repository
or a new JCR content repository. Note however that the main goal of this
package is to simplify, not to optimize JCR implementations. Much of the
implemented functionality is (and will always be) slow and unnecessarily
resource-intensive due to these constraints.
