Immutable and session-bound frontend to node type information.
<p>
The classes in this package implement the
{@link javax.jcr.nodetype JCR node type interfaces} based on an underlying
node type state and the current session. The implementation uses aggressive
caching of node type information, and is therefore not suitable for
applications where the node types need to be modified within a session.
