Node type state implementation.
<p>
The classes in this package provide a simple and straightforward mechanism
for holding and managing node type information. The node type information
managed by this package is mutable and not bound to a specific session.
The {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.session.nodetype
org.apache.jackrabbit.session.nodetype} package implements the standard
{@link javax.jcr.nodetype JCR node type interfaces} based on underlying
node type state managed by classes from this package.
</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<h3>State equality</h3>
<p>
Although in most use cases the node type state instances do not change
once they have been created and properly configured, but they still are
mutable and it is possible for their state to change. Thus none of these
classes override the default {@link Object#equals(Object) equals()} and
{@link Object#hashCode() hashCode()} methods that are based on reference
equality.
