General base classes for implementing the JCR interfaces.
<p>
This package contains simple base class implementations of the JCR API
interfaces. These classes implement the API methods either by throwing
Unsupported(Repository)OperationExceptions or by calling other API methods.
For example the Property.getString() method is implemented as
Property.getValue().getString(). See the javadoc comments of each method
for implementation details.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this package is to make it easy to incrementally implement
the JCR API without creating a large numbers of stub methods. A JCR
implementation class can inherit one of these base classes and only override
the methods it needs.
</p>
<h2>Desing principles</h2>
<p>
The base classes in this package follow the design principles listed below.
The purpose of these design principles is to avoid introducing unnecessary
dependencies or complexities.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    No member variables. To avoid introducing any extra memory overhead
    or complex state and object equality issues, none of these base classes
    have any member variables, private or otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Protected default constructors. Each base class contains only an empty
    protected default constructor. This guarantees that these classes can not
    be instantiated unless subclassed.
  </li>
  <li>
    No extra methods. The only non-private methods defined in these base
    classes are the empty protected default constructor and the public
    methods declared in the JCR interfaces. Private utility methods are
    allowed to avoid duplicating code, but no protected or public methods
    other than those declared by the JCR API are allowed.
  </li>
</ul>
