General base classes for JCR implementations.
<p>
This package contains simple base class implementations of the JCR API
interfaces. The API methods are implemented either by throwing
{@link javax.jcr.UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException UnsupportedRepositoryOperationExceptions}
or
{@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException UnsupportedOperationExceptions},
or (if possible) by calling other API methods. The implementation mechanism
of each method is documented using the respective Javadoc comment.
<p>
The purpose of this package is to make it easy for JCR implementations
to implement the JCR API incrementally without creating a large numbers of
stub methods.
