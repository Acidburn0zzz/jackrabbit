Node type state implementation.
<p>
The classes in this package provide a simple and straightforward mechanism
for holding and managing node type information. The node type information
managed by this package is mutable and not bound to a specific session.
The {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.session.nodetype} package implements the
standard {@link javax.jcr.nodetype JCR node type interfaces} based on
underlying node type state managed by classes from this package.
