Known Issues and TODOs with jcr2spi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- BUG: Observation: filtering events by nodetype, uuid doesn't work

- BUG: Reverting combined move/reorder operations

- IMPROVE: AddNode 
   In order to be able to return the created Node, it would be required to
