- IMPROVE: Replace ItemState-duality by copy on write behaviour

- BUG: NodeEntryImpl needs an attic for transiently moved and removed
       child entries in order not to access those from the persistent
       storage again.
       In addition: having an attic allows to properly handle events
       notifying external modifications for those moved/removed
       NodeEntries, that are not identified by a uniqueID
       
- BUG: Node.hasProperty currently returns false, if prop-entry has
       not been loaded yet -> should use same mechanism as Node.getProperty.
       
- IMPROVE: Refreshing and reloading states, that are transiently modified.

- IMPROVE: review if ItemStateExceptions are really needed. currently
           they are created from RepositoryExceptions and rethrown as
           RepositoryExceptions
           
- IMPROVE: consistency of PathNotFoundException and ItemNotFoundException.
