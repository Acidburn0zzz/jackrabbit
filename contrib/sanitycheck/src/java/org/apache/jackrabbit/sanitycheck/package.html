	This package provides:
	<ul>
		<li>Consistency checks</li>
		<li>Inconsistency repair</li>
	</ul>
	Custom checks and fixes can be added trough 
	a simple commons-chain configuration file
	(see sanity-check-chain.xml).
	</p>
	<p> 
		In order to be sure that all the check were performed against every 
		node in the repository keep running the tool until no inconsistency is 
		found. Some inconsistencies prevent the tool of checking the entire 
		repository.
