Summary
=======
This contribution shows you how you can compile the jar's of the binary Jackrabbit distribution into .NET assemblies using the ikvmc.exe bytestream compiler (http://www.ikvm.net/)
Usage of the assemblies (dll's) is illustrated by converting the three "first hops" java demo's into C# code and starting this code from within a VS 2005 project.

Steps
=====
Check "jackrabbit-net.txt" for the steps involved.

Although the demos are working, this work is too premature to tell you anything about the usability, stability, or performance of this contribution.
