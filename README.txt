=============================================================
Welcome to Apache Jackrabbit  <http://jackrabbit.apache.org/>
=============================================================

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the
Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). A content repository
is a hierarchical content store with support for structured and
unstructured content, full text search, versioning, transactions,
observation, and more. Typical applications that use content
repositories include content management, document management,
and records management systems.

Version 1.0 of the JCR API was specified by the Java Specification
Request 170 (JSR 170, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170) and work
on the JCR version 2.0 has begun in JSR 283.

Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.
