Utility classes for importing SAX event streams.
<p>
The classes in this package can be used for to implement the JCR
{@link javax.jcr.Session#getImportContentHandler(java.lang.String) Session.getImportContentHandler(String)}
and
{@link javax.jcr.Workspace#getImportContentHandler(java.lang.String, int) Workspace.getImportContentHandler(String, int)}
methods in terms of the corresponding importXML() methods.
<p>
These utility classes were designed for the transparent JCR-RMI layer,
but can easily be used as a part of any JCR repository implementation.
The public interface of this package depends only on the standard JCR and
J2SE APIs. The implementation uses Xerces as an extra dependency to
serialize the SAX event streams.
