Remote interfaces of the transparent JCR-RMI layer.
<p>
This package contains all the interfaces and classes used by both
the client and server sides of the transparent JCR-RMI layer.
The compiled contents of this package should thus be included
in both client and server installations. Note also that RMI stubs and
skeletons need to be generated for all the remote interfaces when using
old JDK versions (stubs for JDK < 1.5, skeletons for JDK < 1.2).
<p>
The interfaces in this package are remote versions of the
corresponding interfaces in the javax.jcr packages. They are used by
the adapter classes in the .rmi.client and .rmi.server packages. The server
classes adapt local JCR objects to the remote interfaces, and the client
classes adapt the resulting remote references back to the JCR interfaces.
<p>
The SerialValue class is a decorator utility used by both the client and
server classes to safely pass Value objects over the network.
