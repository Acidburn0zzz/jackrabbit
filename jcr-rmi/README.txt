Welcome to JCR-RMI
==================

JCR-RMI is a transparent Remote Method Invocation (RMI) layer for
the Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). The layer makes
it possible to remotely access JCR content repositories. JCR-RMI is
developed as a part of the Apache Jackrabbit project, but
the implementation is compatible with all JCR content repositories.
