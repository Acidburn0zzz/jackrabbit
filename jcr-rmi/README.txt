==================
Welcome to JCR-RMI
==================

JCR-RMI is a transparent Remote Method Invocation (RMI) layer for
the Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). The layer makes
it possible to remotely access JCR content repositories. JCR-RMI is
developed as a part of the incubating Apache Jackrabbit project, but
the implementation is compatible with all JCR content repositories.

Apache Jackrabbit is an effort undergoing incubation at the
Apache Software Foundation. Incubation is required of all newly
accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a
reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it
does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed
by the ASF.  The incubation status is recorded at

   http://incubator.apache.org/projects/jackrabbit.html
