        <section name="Documentation">
            <p>
                For a basic overview and details on getting started, have a look at
                the <a href="doc/index.html">Jackrabbit documention</a> on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jackrabbit exposes most of its functionality to client applications thought that the JCR v1.0 API.
                If you want more detail on the API you can browse the Javadoc at
                <a href="http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0" class="externalLink" title="External Link">http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0</a><br/>
                or download it as a zipped package at <a href="http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0.javadoc" class="externalLink" title="External Link">http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0.javadoc</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you really want to know all the details, the best current documentation available
                is the JCR v1.0 specification itself, which you can get here:
                <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr170/index.html" class="externalLink" title="External Link">http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr170/index.html</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to implementing the JCR API, Jackrabbit has many extensions and
                admistrational features that are not (yet) specified by JCR.
                (see <a href="doc/arch/overview.html">Architecture Overview</a>). You can browse the
                internal Jackrabbit API here: <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/apidocs/index.html">http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/apidocs/index.html</a>
