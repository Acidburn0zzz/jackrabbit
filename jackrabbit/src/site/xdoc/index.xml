            <p>
                The Apache Jackrabbit project is an effort to build and maintain an open source
                implementation of the Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR).
            </p>
            <p>
                JCR 1.0 is specified in

                Work on JCR v2.0 has begun in <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283" class="externalLink" title="External Link">JSR 283</a>.

            <p>
                For a basic overview and details on getting started, have a look at
                the <a href="doc/index.html">Jackrabbit documentation</a> on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jackrabbit exposes most of its functionality to client applications thought that the JCR v1.0 API.
                If you want more detail on the API you can browse the
                <a href="http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0" class="externalLink" title="External Link">Javadoc</a>
                or download it as a
                <a href="http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0.javadoc" class="externalLink" title="External Link">zipped package</a>
                (right click and select "Save as...").
            </p>
            <p>
                If you really want to know all the details, the best current documentation available
                is the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr170/index.html" class="externalLink" title="External Link">JCR v1.0 specification</a> itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to implementing the JCR API, Jackrabbit has many extensions and
                administrational features that are not (yet) specified by JCR.
                (see <a href="doc/arch/overview.html">Architecture Overview</a>).
                You can also browse the internal Jackrabbit API in the
                <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/apidocs/index.html">Jackrabbit Javadocs</a>.
