    <title>Model 1: The (Web-) Application Bundle HOWTO</title>
  </properties>
  <body>
    <section name="Model 1: The (Web-) Application Bundle HOWTO">
      <p>
        This document describes how to setup a Jackrabbit content repository
        in the deployment model 1; The (Web-) Application Bunde. In this
        deployment model, each application bundle uses its own local content
        repository that is not visible to other applications. See the
        <a href="howto-client.html">JCR client application HOWTO</a> for
        instructions on how to use the configured content repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that it is also possible to bypass the JNDI mechanism by
        including all the Jackrabbit startup and configuration code directly
        in your application. This approach however makes a strong binding
        between your application and the underlying repository implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The instructions in this document apply to
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>
        versions 4.x and 5.x. It should be easy to modify the
        instructions for other container environments. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> remember that two Jackrabbit instances
        should never read from/write to the same physical storage.
        This setup is not supported and will lead to corrupt data.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Tomcat instructions">
      <p>
        Follow the steps below to setup a model 1 Jackrabbit deployment
        for your web application in Tomcat 4.x or 5.x. Example code for
        both versions of Tomcat is included after this overview.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the Jackrabbit jar file and all the dependencies (including
          the JCR API jar file) under
          <code>[Tomcat folder]/webapps/[your app]/WEB-INF/lib</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Register a bindable repository factory in the context
          scope. Configure the Java class name of the factory
          implementation, as well as the repository configuration
          file path and the repository home directory path. Use the
          full path in both cases.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> the application should not be
        redeployed during the same JVM process to avoid creating duplicate
        Jackrabbit instances with the same configuration. In case you want
        to redeploy your application be sure to shutdown the repository
        when your application is undeployed. It can be done by calling 
        RepositoryImpl.shutdown() (e.g. in the destroy() method of a 
        servlet).
      </p>
      <subsection name="Step 2 - Context configuration">
        <p>
          In Tomcat 4.x and 5.0, add the following snippet in
          <code>server.xml</code> under the <code>Context</code> element
          of your web application.
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
<Resource name="jcr/repository"
          auth="Container"
          type="javax.jcr.Repository"/>

<ResourceParams name="jcr/repository">
  <parameter>
    <name>factory</name>
    <value>org.apache.jackrabbit.core.jndi.BindableRepositoryFactory</value>

    <value>[full path to the repository home folder]</value>
  </parameter>
</ResourceParams>
]]></source>
        <p>
          In Tomcat 5.5, add the following snippet in your application's
          <code>context.xml</code> file (or in the <code>server.xml</code>
          file if you prefer central configuration).
        </p>
