The Jackrabbit source code is available via Subversion at
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk</a>
</p>
<p>
and anonymous access is available at
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk</a>
</p>
<p>or with viewcvs at
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk/">http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk/</a>
</p>
<p>The Jackrabbit main project is located in the "jackrabbit" subdirectory
and the "contrib" subdirectory contains various additional modules and
contributed projects.</p>

<p>To checkout the main Jackrabbit source tree, run
<source>
   svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit
</source>
</p>
<p>
Once you have a copy of the source code tree, you can use Apache Maven

   <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</a>

to build the project.  After installing Maven 1.0, be sure to download the
latest release of the Ant plugin (1.8.1 or later) using a command like
<source>
   maven plugin:download -DgroupId=maven \
         -DartifactId=maven-ant-plugin -Dversion=1.8.1
</source>

before running one of the maven commands listed at

   <a href="http://maven.apache.org/start/use.html">http://maven.apache.org/start/use.html</a>

to build the Jackrabbit project and/or documentation.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Java 5 users need to download the xalan.jar and serializer.jar
libraries from the Xalan-Java binary distribution at 
http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/downloads.html and place them in
$MAVEN_HOME/lib/endorsed (or $JRE/lib/endorsed if using Maven 1.1)
to build the Jackrabbit sources. The reason for this workaround is
explained in
   <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-46">http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-46</a>
