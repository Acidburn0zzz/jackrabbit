#
# Properties file to preload the MockRepository with content.
# Each session created by the MockRepository upon calling login
# reads this file to define a structure of content.
#
# Each property in this file defines a single item. The name
# of the property is the absolute path to the item defined.
# Order of the definitions in this file is relevant in that
# intermediate nodes are automatically defined as
# nt:unstructured nodes and may not be redefined later.
#
# The value of each property is a series of comma-separated
# fields. The first field must either be "n" to indicate a
# Node or "p" to indicate a Property. Any other values results
# in the property being ignored for item creation. The remaining
# fields depend on whether a Node or Property is defined.
#
# For nodes the fields are:
#   1  -  "n" to indicate the definition of a Node
#   2  -  The name of the node type, may be any string not
#         not containing a comma. The default value is
#         "nt:unstructured"
#   3  -  The name of the primary item. This may be missing
#         in which case there is no primary item or a well
#         known default value is used. For nt:file typed
#         nodes, the default is "jcr:content" for nt:resource
#         typed nodes, the default is "jcr:data"
#
# For Properties the fields are:
#   1  -  "p" to indicate the definition of a Property
#   2  -  The name of the property type. This must be one
#         of the type names defined in the PropertyType
#         class. If empty or or unknown, "String" is used
#         as the default.
#   3  -  The value of the property to the defined. The
#         value must be acceptable for the
#         ValueFactory.createValue(int type, String value)
#         method. If empty or missing, an empty string is
#         used as the property value, which may not be
#         acceptable for all property types.
#
# Property values (last field in the property definition) may
# span multiple lines. Each line must be terminated with the
# backslash character indicating the continuation of the line on
# the next line of file.
