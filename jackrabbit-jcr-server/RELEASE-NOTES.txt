        The source archive contains the full source code of this release
        in a "jackrabbit-jcr-server-1.4.1" directory. Use the following commands
        (or the equivalent in your environment) to build the component
        with Maven 2 and Java 1.4 or higher:

          $ jar xf jackrabbit-jcr-server-1.4.1-src.jar
          $ cd jackrabbit-1.4.1
          $ mvn install
